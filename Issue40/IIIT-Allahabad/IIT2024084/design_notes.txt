Design Concept: "Rangrez" Technicolor Truck Art

Summary:
This design evolves the vintage "Rangara" Bollywood theme into the 2025 "Rangrez" visual identity. It combines the cinematic elements of the 70s with the high-saturation colors and bold strokes of Indian Truck Art.

Key Features:
- Typography: Custom-modified Rozha One with film-strip sprocket holes on the 'F' stems.
- Lighting: The letter 'V' acts as a premiere night spotlight with a Marigold beam.
- Decor: Added Cyan/White geometric patterns to mimic "Sheesha" (mirror work) embroidery.
- Truck Art Style: Applied a thick 8px White Stroke and Royal Blue (#0047AB) hard shadow to create the signature hand-painted 3D sticker look.

Colors: Magenta (#FF007F) to Yellow (#FFD700) Gradient.
Tools: Figma.

//Design Process & Iteration:
I initially developed a "Technicolor Disco" concept focused solely on the 70s gradient style (Pink/Orange with Indigo shadow). However, to better align with the 2025 "Rangrez" theme, I evolved it.
